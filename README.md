# ProtonMail MailTo Link Handler

Built this for myself, but thought I'd share just in case someone else needed it too.

## Installation

1. From Firefox, **[click here](https://github.com/comradedakota/pmlh/releases/download/stable/pmlh-1.0.0.xpi)**.
2. Click **"Continue to Installation"** on the dialog box that pops up from your Extensions icon.
3. Click **"Add"**.
4. From the **["Settings" page](about:preferences)**, under **"Applications"** change the `mailto` action to **"Use ProtonMail MailTo Link Handler"**.
5. Enjoy. ;-)
